          <h3 class="heading">ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLAND</h3>
          <div class="text"><p>
              <br>
            Andaman and Nicobar Islands are so silently tucked away from the eyes of the world, it is difficult to spot them on a map so easily. It is home to some of the last remaining tribes of our planet Earth, which makes this place a lot intriguing.
        <br>
            Even though there are 572 islands in total here, however, every island is not accessible to the general public. Some of them are in fact inhabited. If you will look clearly on Google maps, you will find Andaman to be closer to Thailand than to India. Yet these islands are a part of India. Due to its interesting position, the islands have suffered a lot in terms of wars and international conspiracies.
        <br>
            Over here you will find intensive check posts and presence of the Indian army. The islands are heavily guarded but despite all of this, these islands are a perfect place to spend your holidays. The oceans are crystal clear, the color of the water is deep blue and the place has a magic of its own.
            <br>
            Ross Island also known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island served as the headquarters for the Britishers once upon a time. Now, you can only see the ruins that are covered with wild vines, roots, and trunks on the walls of these old buildings. You have to take a ferry to reach here. You can easily book one ferry at the waterfront. The waterfront is very close to Corbyn’s Cove Beach.
        <br>
Tapu-Another perfect beach to watch the sunset. Although it is a little far from the main market and the roads are rough but it is worth it. You will find limited crowd here as compared to Corbyn’s Cove. You can also visit the biosphere park where you will find several types of animals and birds. A perfect place to for a forest walk.

              <h3 class="heading">UTTARAKHAND</h3>
              <div class="text"><p>

There are many ancient temples, forest reserves, national parks, hill stations, and mountain peaks that draw large number of tourists. There are 44 nationally protected monuments in the state.

Binsar Devta is a popular Hindu temple in the area.
                <br>
                Uttarakhand has long been called "Land of the Gods as the state has some of the holiest Hindu shrines, and for more than a thousand years, pilgrims have been visiting the region in the hopes of salvation and purification from sin. Gangotri and Yamunotri, the sources of the Ganges and Yamuna, dedicated to Ganga and Yamuna respectively, fall in the upper reaches of the state and together with Badrinath (dedicated to Vishnu) and Kedarnath (dedicated to Shiva) form the Chota Char Dham, one of Hinduism's most spiritual and auspicious pilgrimage circuits. Haridwar, meaning "Gateway to the God", is a prime Hindu destination. Haridwar hosts the Haridwar Kumbh Mela every twelve years, in which millions of pilgrims take part from all parts of India and the world. Rishikesh near Haridwar is known as the preeminent yoga centre of India. The state has an abundance of temples and shrines, many dedicated to local deities or manifestations of Shiva and Durga, references to many of which can be found in Hindu scriptures and legends.

                  <div class="text"><p>
                    Ladakh is as mysterious as it is beautiful. With its monasteries and its mountains, Ladakh showcases a way of life that many people living in urban landscapes assume is lost forever. But the old ways still flourish in Ladakh, as do its people. There are numerous ethnic groups here, with Tibetans, Monpas, Dards and Muslims among them. So there’s a rich diversity in the culture here. From their cuisine to their dressing, the Ladakhis stand out exceptionally. If you are on a tour during their festivals, you will be treated to a number of delightful customs and colourful celebrations.
                <br>
                   Tourism in Leh and Ladakh is a huge factor in improving the economy and lives of the people of this region. Leh Ladakh tourism has evolved over the years and now brings in not just those who want to sightsee but also adventure enthusiasts who are keen on activities like white water river rafting, paragliding, mountaineering and skiing.
                <br>
                    Leh is the most well-known city of Ladakh. Surrounded by towering mountain ranges and serene lakes, it offers a very different tourism experience to visitors. With its dry and barren landscape enlivened by the colourful Buddhist monasteries, Leh creates a magical travel experience. The nine-storeyed Leh Palace should definitely be included in your Ladakh tour.
                <br>
                    Nubra Valley is another popular spot for tourists who are visiting Ladakh. Its proximity to Leh makes it easy to visit. It is also known as the Orchard of Ladakh. Nubra Valley is remote and yet draws tourists who come to see places like the Diskit Monastery, Hunder Monastery, Maitreya Buddha statue and of course, the world famous Khardung La Pass. There are hot water springs here alon with the Yarab Tso lake which is considered sacred. 
                <br>
                    Pangong Lake is an intense blue lake in the middle of the mountains. Recent Bollywood movies have made this a well-known spot. Tourists who visit Ladakh throng to this spot. The lake is an important breeding ground for several migratory birds. But Pangong is a remote area and the lake freezes during the winters. The beauty of Pangong Lake is almost surreal and needs to be experienced first-hand. 
                <br>
                    Another place of interest during a Ladakh tour is Zanskar Valley, an isolated region famed for its mountains and stunning landscape. This relatively unexplored region in Ladakh has a pleasant climate, beautiful views and glimmering rivers which makes it perfect for a holiday.
                <br>
                   Apart from this, you can visit Kargil, Drass, Suru Valley, the intriguing Magnetic Hill on the Leh-Kargil-Srinagar highway. The famed Khardung La Pass, with its gorgeous views of the valley and roads, is considered to be the gateway to the Shyok and Nubr Valleys. It is one of the highest motorable passes in the world.

                        Beaches are love, especially to me who has always been more a beach person than a mountain person. And last year, I was able to spend time at the most beautiful beaches in Seychelles. Trust me, once you have been to the beaches of Seychelles and Mauritius, you have a hard time finding other beaches as charming.
                    <br>
                       But Goa is known for its beaches and parties. And even though it is not Seychelles, it is definitely one of the best beach destinations in India. There is a lot you can do in Goa apart from spending time in the water.
                      <br>
                        One of the best things to do in Goa is to spend some time on the beautiful beaches here. So, we have mentioned a few of the best beaches in Goa that you should visit for an amazing Goan experience. 
                    <br>
                       Colva Beach-One of the best places to visit in South Goa, Colva Beach is one of the top beaches in Goa. This place is perfect for families and friends and has several restaurants and shacks for an epic night out. You also have a few Karaoke places here to have some fun here.
                     <br>
                         If you are interested in water sports then Colva Beach is the best place for it in South Goa.
                        <br>
                         Beach-Another one of the top beaches in Goa, Baga Beach lies in the North Goa and is best known for its party street. Trust me, this is one of the best places to visit in North Goa if you are looking for an all-night partying scene. You have some famous clubs and pubs here like Mambo’s, Tito’s, etc.
                        <br>
                        But that is not all, the Baga Beach has been completely transformed in the past couple of years. So, when you reach here at night, you will find a lot of open-bar shacks with platforms here for partying. And usually, these beach parties continue till 12-1 a.m. After that, you can enter one of the local bars like Mambo.
                    <br>
                        Querim Beach-Also known as the Keri beach, Querim beach is one of the best places to visit in North Goa. This is the northernmost beach in Goa and has unique scenery with rocky outcrops and a river inlet of River Tiracol. Situated north to the Arambol beach, one has to walk between the Sweet Water Lake and Querim beach to reach here.
                    <br>
                        But the entire hike is worth the effort when you can relax on this quiet and gorgeous beach which is lined with rows of trees.
