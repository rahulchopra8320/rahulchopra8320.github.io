        Surrounded by the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, the country of Australia is located in the continent of Oceania, and is the sixth largest country in the world.

    Sydney is the capital of New South Wales and known for its harbour front Opera House, towering Sydney Tower’s glass viewing and the skywalk. Melbourne is Victoria’s coastal capital, famed for its arts, food and cultural events. Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, is famous for Queensland Museum and Queensland Gallery of Modern Art. Perth, the capital of Western Australia, is a place that sits on the cusp of Swan River and southwest coast, flaunting riverside botanical garden and parks.

    Aussies are open and direct in their speech and sometimes can be sarcastic in their humour. Australia is an egalitarian society where there is no class distinction. The culture is heavily influenced by the British be it language, religion or sports.
