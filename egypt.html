The country, thus, is rich in history and culture since time immemorial.

Valley of the Kings and famous cities like Hurghada, Alexandria, Luxor boast a rich heritage and are interesting places to visit.
        <br>
      
            Egyptian cuisine is a popular world cuisine - an eclectic fusion of the various civilizations that have made Egypt their home over the years. Kebabs and rice are the staple diet, flavored with spices. Baba ghannoug, a paste made from eggplants, and a variety of koftas are served with different courses.
    <br>
        
            You don’t need to browse through hundreds of holiday destinations across the globe for your perfect vacation. From its sun, sea, and sand interspersed with a touch of exotic culture and heritage, ancient monuments, vast deserts, world famous coral reefs to cosmopolitan cities -the mesmerizing land of Egypt has it all!
