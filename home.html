      <h3 class="heading">TRAVEL BLOG</h3>
      <div class="text"><ul>
        <li>  A travel blogger is someone who travels around the world collecting material for writing about their travel experiences, deriving income from a variety of on-line and off-line sources.
        </li>
          <li>  A travel blogger is a freelance writer who maintains their own blog site and attempts to derive income from the value in their written articles and features. The travel blogger must travel to a destination country (or more typically, a series of countries) in order to obtain exciting, informative experiences which he or she will then host on their blog site. They will also usually be required to upload good quality photography to illustrate the pieces.
        </li>
          <li>  Although the actual process of travelling and blogging does not result in any form of salary, revenues can be obtained from a variety of methods. The first is from advertising; a popular blog site with many thousands of followers represents a valuable marketing channel, both for product suppliers and for hospitality destinations. Often, a hotel may contact a blogger and offer them a free stay in exchange for a positive feature about their property. Other companies may offer the blogger free travel equipment, or simply purchase banner advertising on the site. Additionally, completed features hosted on the blog can be offered to print media who will publish travel stories in exchange for cash.  
        </li>
           <li>The actual 'conditions of work' form the whole experience of a travel adventure. Most bloggers will experience a variety of different accommodation levels, so one trip may be to a luxury resort by the Andaman Sea, returning to a small apartment in Bangkok for a few days, before heading out for a three day jungle adventure, with nothing but a backpack and mosquito repellent. People tend to enjoy travelling or not enjoy it; those that love it tend to find it hard to settle down, always feeling the need to explore new places and tell others about their experience.
        </li> 
          <li>  From the first trip, the travel blogger will be accumulating experience on a number of levels. Firstly, the need to create professional written content, upload it to a blog, manage the pages and promote the travel blog are specific skills which are usually self-taught through experience. Secondly, continuing travel trips give the blogger a thick skin, making them more able to deal with difficult situations as they arise whilst in the field; the first Asian trekking adventure, for example, is a daunting experience for many, as the blogger will need to deal with mosquito bites, crushing humidity, language and navigational difficulties and a variety of potentially dangerous eventualities. After the writer has completed three such trips, they will probably be able to offer strong experiential advice to other travellers. This is how meaningful and valuable content translates to advertising revenues through a successful blog. 
        </li>
           <li> Although not relevant per se, experienced travel writers and bloggers will develop a burgeoning portfolio of contacts, making it more likely that future travel features they complete will be published in print (or well funded by sponsors). Well capitalised bloggers will be able to explore exotic and remote locations beyond the reach of inexperienced bloggers with limited resources.
