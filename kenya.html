           Situated in Africa, Kenya has the distinction of lying on the earthâ€™s equator. It lies in Eastern Africa, bordered by Ethiopia to the north, South Sudan to the northwest, Somalia to the north-east, Uganda to the west, and Tanzania to the south, with its coastline flanked by the Indian Ocean. Its largest city is the capital city of Nairobi. Kenya provides a diverse ecological mix from the great rift valley to mountain highlands to the Savannah grasslands to a prolific range of wild animals.
        <br>
          Maasai Mara is one of the world's most magnificent game reserves while also being a wildlife habitat. The park is famous for the great migration when wildebeest, Thomson's gazelle, and zebra travel to and fro the Serengeti National Park, during the months from July to October and the lion, cheetah, and leopard in the months from December to February. Samburu also houses some rare animals that you must not miss.
        <br>
          If it is the grasslands that interest you, then Amboseli is the place for you, it also gives a peak of the snow-capped Mount Kilimanjaro - the highest mountain of Africa. Along with this, making it to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lamu Old Town is Kenya's oldest continually inhabited settlement with origins dating back since the 12th century. Amongst other places to visit, you must not miss Lake Nakuru - renowned for its thousands of pink flamingoes and Mount Kenya - the second largest mountain in Africa. Kenya's beautiful silver sand beaches lined with palm trees, also entice many travellers.
        <br>
          Kenya is often noted as the Cradle of Humanity by historians. The earliest evidence of the existence of human life has been found here.
        <br>
          No single dish represents the whole of Kenya. Different communities have their native foods. Kenyan cuisine is also influenced by the numerous tribes and their preferences.Undeniably Ugali and irio are the most prominent dishes, and if you are a rice lover, you must sample the options that Kenya has to offer- Wali wa nazu, which is rice flavored with coconut and Kenyan Pilau, which infuses the local spices.
        <br>
          Kenya is the destination for you if you seek an adventure that is soaked in an ancient colorful culture and peppered with rare natural sights. Famed as the world center for animal safaris and active adventure holidays, Kenya is an absolute must-visit for the wildlife enthusiast.
